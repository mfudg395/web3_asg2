/**
* The general data flow of the "Play Details" view is as follows:
* 1. If the selected play has characters and text, that Play object is retrieved and set to the playInfo hook.
*      - The hasPlayInfo hook is then set to "true"; if hasPlayInfo is false, the Characters and Text tabs will disappear.
* 
* 2. The textSelection hook is filled with default data; that is, ACT I, SCENE I, and allPlayers.
*      - textSelection is an object that contains the user's selected act, scene, and speaker, with each stored as a string.
*      - Not to be confused with textTabSelected, which is an unrelated boolean stating if the user is in the "Text" tab.
*
* 3. The details for the selected play are rendered, and textSelection is passed as a prop to the PlayDetailTabs and 
*    PlayTextSearch components.
*      - PlayDetailTabs is the component that contains the "Details", "Characters", and "Text" tabs. The "Text" tab shows the
*        play's script for the currently selected act, scene, and speaker (or all speakers, if that's what's selected).
*      - PlayTextSearch contains the dropdown menus to select different acts/scenes/speakers. Whenever one of these menus
*        is changed, setTextSelection is called to update the new chosen act/scene/speaker, and PlayDetailTabs is re-rendered
*        to reflect those changes.
*
* 4. When rendering the "Text" tab, the selected act, scene, and speaker will propogate down to each component in this order:
*    PlayDetailTabs > PlayText > PlayAct > PlayScene > PlaySpeech
*      - PlayDetailTabs could be considered the highest level component in this hierarchy, since it contains our playInfo and
*        textSelection hooks. These hooks are passed as props to the above components so that each act, scene, and speech can
*        be rendered according to the user's selection.
